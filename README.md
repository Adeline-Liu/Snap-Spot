# Snap Spot - A MERN Stack Geo-Tagging App

Snap Spot is a personal project that serves as a testament to my journey through full-stack web development. The app uses the MERN stack to provide a platform for users to share and discover places through geotagged images. It is an ongoing work that reflects my evolving understanding of web technologies and my commitment to building functional, user-centered applications.

## About the Project

Snap Spot aims to encapsulate the features of modern social platforms while emphasizing the joy of discovering new places. It's designed to test and demonstrate my skills in both front-end and back-end development, including real-time data handling, responsive web design, and RESTful API architecture.

## Features
Geotagged Posts: Users can post images with geolocation data, sharing their favorite spots with others.
CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete functionality for managing user-contributed content.
Image Storage: Integration with MongoDB GridFS for efficient image storage.

## Tech Stack
Front-End: React.js for a dynamic user interface
Back-End: Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic
Database: MongoDB for data management, with GridFS for image storage

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
